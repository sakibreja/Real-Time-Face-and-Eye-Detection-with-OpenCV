# Real-Time-Face-and-Eye-Detection-with-OpenCV

Excited to share my latest project: a Python-based real-time face and eye detection system using OpenCV! 👩‍💻👁️

💡 Highlights of the project:

1. Detects faces and eyes in real-time using Haar cascades.
2. Built with object-oriented programming for modular and reusable code.
3. Showcases the power of computer vision for interactive applications.


This project has been a great opportunity to dive deeper into Python, OpenCV, and computer vision techniques. Special thanks to Sakib Reja sir for his invaluable guidance and support during the development process. 🙏
